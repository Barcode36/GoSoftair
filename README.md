# GoSoftair
Web application for softair players

In this application you can create matches in 5 different categories, create advertisements to sell/buy stuff and gain points based on your performance in matches. 
Registered users can sign up for a game, create a game, comment a game and insert advertisements. Not registered users can see everithing but can't "partecipate to the community".
Once a match is finished, the next day its creator has to assign points to the participants. There is a general classification based on points gained.
All users can edit their profiles and their advertisements. Only the administrator can edit matches, in order to not confuse the signed in players.

Developed with XAMPP. Used Smarty as template engine and PDO to connect to the database. Used Javascript for server side controls with some JQuery plugins like "validator" and "datepicker".
Uses sessions.
